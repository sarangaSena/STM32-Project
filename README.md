# STM32 Bare-Metal Programming using C Projects

Development of STM32 projects using C language targets open community support and learning. This repository provides accessible, well-documented examples to guide users from basic to advanced levels of embedded systems programming.

## üìò Project Scope

Projects cover essential topics for STM32 microcontroller development:

- GPIO control  
- Timers and counters  
- ADC (Analog to Digital Conversion)  
- UART serial communication  
- I2C and SPI protocols  
- PWM signal generation  
- FreeRTOS integration  

Each example includes:

- Clean and structured C source code  
- Register-level peripheral configuration  
- Project setup with STM32CubeIDE or compatible toolchains  
- Inline comments explaining each step  
- Practical insights into debugging and optimization  

## üéØ Purpose

Designed to:

- Bridge the gap between academic theory and real-world embedded development  
- Assist students, hobbyists, and professionals in mastering STM32 programming  
- Support transition from platforms like Arduino to advanced STM32 architectures
